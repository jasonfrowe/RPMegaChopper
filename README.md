### *Rescue the Hostages. Blast Tanks. Unleash Retro Fury on the RP6502 Picocomputer!*

**RPMegaChopper** is a high-octane homage to Dan Gorlin's legendary *Choplifter* – rebuilt from the rotors up for the badass [RP6502 Picocomputer](https://picocomputer.github.io/).

Fly behind enemy lines in your **red-trimmed rescue chopper**, save 64 brave hostages from 4 fortified POW camps, and show those tanks, drones, and fighter jets what a pilot from the Great White North can do. You’re not just here to say "Sorry"—you’re here to clear the skies. 💥🗺️

Armed with **precision physics** and **heavy firepower**, you'll hover, rotate, bomb, and bullet your way to glory. *Eh? Who's ready to save the day?*

## 📩 **Mission Briefing: Operation Northern Lights**
**TO:** Captain Neutrino Snow, 1st Rotor Wing  
**FROM:** HQ (Sudbury Deep Command)  
**SUBJECT:** P.O.W. Extraction Protocol

Listen up, ace. The enemy has 64 of our best peacekeepers locked down in four fortified bunkers across enemy territory. A direct assault is suicide, but Intelligence has a plan.

**CSIS operatives have already infiltrated the camps.** They've rigged the blast doors of every prison block with remote-detonated shaped charges. They are marked with a **Red Target Indicator** near the foundation.

**Your Orders:**
1.  **Precision Strike**: You must land a single, accurate shot on the **Red Weak Point** of each base.
2.  **Breach**: The shaped charge will blow the doors outward, unharmed, allowing the hostages to escape.
3.  **Extract**: Touch down, load them up (16 at a time), and get them back to the Canadian base.

## 🎮 **Gameplay: Heroic Hostage Havoc**
Command your chopper through scrolling deserts and hostile airspace. Your mission is simple, but survival is not:

*   **The Mission**: Land near the barracks in each of the **4 enemy bases**. 16 hostages are trapped in each camp (**64 total**). Wait for them to run to the chopper, then airlift them to the safety of the Home Base.
*   **The Threat**: The enemy adapts to your tactics.
    *   **Tanks**: They hold the ground. Fly high to stay out of their shelling range.
    *   **Fighter Jets**: They patrol the stratosphere. If you stay at high altitude too long, they *will* intercept you.
    *   **Air Drops**: Don't get comfortable on the ground. If you loiter too long landing or waiting for hostages, the enemy will call in a bomber to drop a payload on your position.
    *   **Drone Balloons**: Seeker mines that drift into your flight path to block your passage. Shoot them down or fly around them.

**Inspired by the Atari 7800 classic** – featuring tight controls, non-stop action, and that distinct floaty chopper momentum that separates the aces from the rookies.

## 🕹️ **Controls: Simple & Deadly**
| Action          | Button/Control                  |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| **Fire**        | Button 1 – **Bullets** (when facing side), **Bombs** (when facing screen)! |
| **Rotate**      | Button 2 – Tap to face left, forward (hover), or right. |
| **Fly**         | Joystick/D-pad – Up/down for altitude, left/right to bank and scroll. |

**Pro Tip**: Hover forward-facing over tanks to drop **tank busting bombs**. The altitude determines if you hit the tank or the ground!
