**RPMegaChopper** is a **proud Canadian homage** to Dan Gorlin's legendary *Choplifter* – rebuilt from the rotors up for the badass [RP6502 Picocomputer](https://picocomputer.github.io/). Fly behind enemy lines in your **Mountie-marked chopper**, rescue 64 brave hostages from 4 fortified POW camps, and show those tanks, anti-air balloons, and fighter jets what a polite "sorry" sounds like... followed by a **BOOM**! 💥🗺️

You're not just a pilot – you're **Captain Tim Hortons**, the Great White North's deadliest rescuer. Armed with **double-double firepower** and **poutine-powered precision**, you'll hover, rotate, bomb, and bullet your way to glory. *Eh? Who's ready to save the day?*

## 🎮 **Gameplay: Heroic Hostage Havoc**
Command your chopper through scrolling deserts, dodging enemy fire while:
- **Rescuing Hostages**: Land near the barracks in each of the **4 enemy bases** (16 hostages per camp – **64 total**!). Pick 'em up and fly 'em home to the US base.
- **Blasting Foes**:
  - **Tanks** rumble below – take 'em out before they shell you!
  - **Anti-air balloons** float up to pop your rotors.
  - **Fighter jets** scream in from the sides – dogfight like a true Canuck ace!
- **Fuel & Lives**: Grab fuel dumps, manage your tank, and survive the gauntlet. Lose too many hostages? Game over, buddy.

**Inspired by the Atari 7800 classic** – tight controls, non-stop action, and that floaty chopper feel that keeps you on the edge!

## 🕹️ **Controls: Simple, Deadly, Canadian**
| Action          | Button/Control                  |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| **Fire**        | Button 1 – **Bullets sideways**, **bombs forward**! |
| **Rotate**      | Button 2 – Face left/right to strafe-shoot, forward to bomb-drop & hover. |
| **Fly**         | Joystick/D-pad – Up/down for altitude, left/right to scroll the map. |

*Pro Move*: Hover forward-facing over tanks for **bomb payloads**. Strafe sideways for bullet barrages. You're untouchable, eh?
