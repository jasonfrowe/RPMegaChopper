**RPMegaChopper** is a high-octane homage to Dan Gorlin's legendary *Choplifter* – rebuilt from the rotors up for the badass [RP6502 Picocomputer](https://picocomputer.github.io/).

Fly behind enemy lines in your **red-trimmed rescue chopper**, save 64 brave hostages from 4 fortified POW camps, and show those tanks, drones, and fighter jets what a pilot from the Great White North can do. You’re not just here to say "Sorry"—you’re here to clear the skies. 💥🗺️

Armed with **precision physics** and **heavy firepower**, you'll hover, rotate, bomb, and bullet your way to glory. *Eh? Who's ready to save the day?*

## 🎮 **Gameplay: Heroic Hostage Havoc**
Command your chopper through scrolling deserts and hostile airspace. Your mission is simple, but survival is not:

*   **The Mission**: Land near the barracks in each of the **4 enemy bases**. 16 hostages are trapped in each camp (**64 total**). Wait for them to run to the chopper, then airlift them to the safety of the Home Base.
*   **The Threat**: The enemy adapts to your tactics.
    *   **Tanks**: They hold the ground. Fly high to stay out of their shelling range.
    *   **Fighter Jets**: They patrol the stratosphere. If you stay at high altitude too long, they *will* intercept you.
    *   **Air Drops**: Don't get comfortable on the ground. If you loiter too long landing or waiting for hostages, the enemy will call in a bomber to drop a payload on your position.
    *   **Drone Balloons**: Seeker mines that drift into your flight path to block your passage. Shoot them down or fly around them.

**Inspired by the Atari 7800 classic** – featuring tight controls, non-stop action, and that distinct floaty chopper momentum that separates the aces from the rookies.

## 🕹️ **Controls: Simple & Deadly**
| Action          | Button/Control                  |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| **Fire**        | Button 1 – **Bullets** (when facing side), **Bombs** (when facing screen)! |
| **Rotate**      | Button 2 – Tap to face left, forward (hover), or right. |
| **Fly**         | Joystick/D-pad – Up/down for altitude, left/right to bank and scroll. |

**Pro Tip**: Hover forward-facing over tanks to drop **depth-charge bombs**. The altitude determines if you hit the tank or the ground!
